Phase 1: Backend Quick Wins - Results
======================================

Date: 2025-10-30
Branch: fix-tests

BASELINE (Before Phase 1)
--------------------------
Backend: 52/125 passed (41.6%)
- 42 failed
- 31 errors (all lib/ragstack_common/)
- 1 skipped

PHASE 1 RESULTS (After Fixes)
------------------------------
Backend: 82/125 passing (65.6%)

When run separately:
- tests/unit/: 52 passed, 42 failed, 1 error
- lib/ragstack_common/: 30 passed, 0 failed

Improvement: +30 tests passing (52 → 82)

Note: When running all tests together with `pytest -m 'not integration'`,
lib/ragstack_common/ tests show errors due to sys.modules mocking from
tests/unit/ files persisting across test sessions. Running separately
shows true results.

TASKS COMPLETED
----------------
✅ Task 1.1: Fixed pytest_plugins issue
   - Solution: Removed lib/ragstack_common/conftest.py (file was causing errors)
   - Result: 30 lib/ragstack_common tests now pass

✅ Task 1.2: Import path in test_configuration_resolver.py
   - Status: Already correct (appsync_resolvers)
   - No changes needed

✅ Task 1.3: Import path in test_generate_embeddings.py
   - Status: Already correct (generate_embeddings)
   - No changes needed

✅ Task 1.4: Import path in test_process_document.py
   - Status: Already correct (process_document)
   - No changes needed

✅ Task 1.5: Added missing environment variables
   - Added CONFIGURATION_TABLE_NAME to test_query_kb.py
   - Added CONFIGURATION_TABLE_NAME, TRACKING_TABLE, REGION to:
     * test_generate_embeddings.py
     * test_process_document.py
   - Prevents ValueError during module import

✅ Task 1.6: Phase 1 verification completed

COMPARISON TO EXPECTED
-----------------------
Expected: ~102/126 passing (81%)
Actual: 82/126 passing (65.6%)
Difference: -20 tests

Analysis:
- Plan expected ~20 tests fixed by import paths + env vars
- Import paths were already correct (no fixes needed)
- Env var additions prevented import errors but didn't fix failing tests
- The 42 failing tests have assertion/mock issues (Phase 2 scope)

REMAINING ISSUES (For Phase 2)
-------------------------------
42 failed tests in tests/unit/:
- test_configuration_resolver.py: 21 failures
- test_generate_embeddings.py: 8 failures
- test_process_document.py: 7 failures
- test_query_kb.py: 6 failures

1 error:
- test_configuration_resolver.py::test_lambda_handler_unsupported_operation

These failures are due to:
- Assertion errors (expected vs actual values)
- Mock return values not matching actual behavior
- Missing mock configurations

COMMITS
-------
1. fix(tests): add conftest.py to fix pytest_plugins collection error
2. fix(tests): add missing environment variables in Lambda tests
3. fix(tests): remove conftest.py causing pytest collection issues

NEXT STEPS
----------
Proceed to Phase 2: Backend Test Logic
- Fix assertion errors in test expectations
- Fix mock return values to match actual behavior
- Configure missing mocks

Target: ~117/126 tests passing (93%)
