## Accessing the Web UI

After deployment, you'll receive a CloudFront URL where the web interface is hosted.

### Finding Your URL

The URL is provided in CloudFormation stack outputs:

```bash
# Get URL from AWS CLI
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name RAGStack-<project-name> \
  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`WebUIUrl`].OutputValue' \
  --output text

# Example output:
# https://d1234567890abc.cloudfront.net
```

Or find it in AWS Console:
1. Go to **CloudFormation** ‚Üí **Stacks**
2. Select your stack (e.g., `RAGStack-<project-name>`)
3. Go to **Outputs** tab
4. Copy the `WebUIUrl` value

## Managing Settings

The Settings page allows you to modify runtime configuration without redeploying the stack. This includes changing OCR backends, embedding models, and response models.

### Accessing Settings

1. Click **Settings** in the navigation menu
2. The Settings page displays all configurable parameters with their current values

### Configuration Parameters

The Settings page shows the following configurable parameters:

#### OCR Backend
Choose how document text extraction is performed:
- **textract** (default): Uses AWS Textract for OCR - faster and cost-effective ($1.50/1000 pages)
- **bedrock**: Uses Bedrock Claude models for OCR - better for complex layouts ($25-75/1000 pages depending on model)

#### Bedrock OCR Model
*Only visible when OCR Backend = "bedrock"*

Select which Claude model to use for OCR:
- **claude-3-5-haiku**: Fastest and most cost-effective
- **claude-3-5-sonnet**: Balanced speed and accuracy
- **claude-3-opus**: Most accurate, best for complex documents

#### Text Embedding Model
Select the model for generating text embeddings:
- **amazon.titan-embed-text-v1**: Titan Text v1 (768 dimensions)
- **amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0**: Titan Text v2 (1024 dimensions, better quality)
- **cohere.embed-english-v3**: Cohere English v3 (1024 dimensions)
- **cohere.embed-multilingual-v3**: Cohere Multilingual v3 (1024 dimensions, supports multiple languages)

#### Image Embedding Model
Select the model for generating image embeddings:
- **amazon.titan-embed-image-v1**: Titan Image v1 (1024 dimensions)

#### Response Model
Select the Bedrock model for Knowledge Base query responses:
- **anthropic.claude-3-5-haiku**: Fastest responses, cost-effective
- **anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-v2**: Balanced speed and quality
- **anthropic.claude-3-opus**: Most detailed responses

### Saving Configuration

1. Modify any parameters using the dropdown menus
2. Click **Save changes** button
3. A success message appears when saved: "Configuration saved successfully"
4. Changes take effect **immediately** on the next document processing or query

**Note**: The Settings page shows which fields have been customized from their default values with a "Customized from default" indicator.

### Resetting Configuration

To revert unsaved changes:
1. Click the **Reset** button
2. Form fields revert to the last saved state
3. No confirmation required

### Changing Embedding Models

Changing the text or image embedding model when you have existing documents requires special attention:

#### Embedding Change Detection

When you change an embedding model and click "Save changes", the system:
1. Checks if you have any completed documents (status = COMPLETED)
2. If documents exist, shows a modal with three options

#### Option 1: Continue with Mixed Embeddings
- **What happens**: Saves the configuration change immediately
- **Effect**: New documents use the new embedding model; existing documents keep their old embeddings
- **Pros**: Fast, no processing required
- **Cons**: Search quality may be inconsistent when comparing old and new documents
- **When to use**: Testing new models, or when documents are independent

#### Option 2: Re-embed All Documents
- **What happens**: Saves configuration and triggers a background job to regenerate all embeddings
- **Effect**: All documents are reprocessed with the new embedding model
- **Pros**: Ensures consistent search quality across all documents
- **Cons**: Takes time (approximately 1 minute per 10 documents)
- **When to use**: Production environments where consistency matters

#### Option 3: Cancel
- **What happens**: Closes the modal without saving
- **Effect**: Embedding model change is discarded; returns to previous value
- **When to use**: Changed your mind about the model switch

### Re-embedding Job Progress

When you choose "Re-embed all documents":

1. **Progress Banner Appears**
   - Shows at the top of the Settings page
   - Displays: "Re-embedding documents: X / Y completed (Z%)"
   - Updates automatically every 5 seconds

2. **Job Details**
   - Total documents being processed
   - Number of documents completed so far
   - Percentage progress

3. **What's Happening**
   - The system triggers the processing pipeline for each document
   - OCR results are reused (not regenerated)
   - Only embeddings are regenerated with the new model
   - Documents are processed in parallel

4. **Job Completion**
   - Banner changes to: "Re-embedding completed! All N documents have been processed."
   - Green success alert appears
   - You can dismiss the alert by clicking the X

5. **During Processing**
   - You can navigate away from the Settings page
   - The job continues in the background
   - When you return, progress is updated
   - You can continue using other parts of the application

**Estimated Time**: Approximately 1 minute per 10 documents (varies by document size and complexity)

### Knowledge Base Compatibility

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Changing embedding models has implications for your Bedrock Knowledge Base.

#### Understanding Knowledge Base Configuration

Your Knowledge Base is configured at creation time with a specific embedding model. The KB expects all documents to use embeddings from that model.

#### Safe Changes (Same Model Family)

Changing within the same model family is **safe**:
- ‚úÖ `amazon.titan-embed-text-v1` ‚Üí `amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0`
- ‚úÖ `cohere.embed-english-v3` ‚Üí `cohere.embed-multilingual-v3`

These changes work because the embedding dimensions and format are compatible.

#### Breaking Changes (Different Model Families)

Changing between different model families will **break search**:
- ‚ùå `amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0` ‚Üí `cohere.embed-english-v3`
- ‚ùå `cohere.embed-english-v3` ‚Üí `amazon.titan-embed-text-v1`

**Why it breaks**: Different model families produce embeddings in different formats and dimensions. The Knowledge Base cannot compare them.

#### What Happens When Search Breaks

If you switch to an incompatible embedding model:
- New documents generate embeddings in the new format
- Knowledge Base expects embeddings in the old format
- Search queries return no results or incorrect results
- No error messages (it fails silently)

#### How to Safely Change Model Families

If you need to switch to a different model family:

1. **Check your current Knowledge Base model**:
   ```bash
   aws bedrock-agent get-knowledge-base --knowledge-base-id <your-kb-id>
   ```
   Look for the `embeddingModelArn` field in the output

2. **Create a new Knowledge Base** with the new embedding model:
   - Go to AWS Console ‚Üí Bedrock ‚Üí Knowledge bases
   - Create new KB with desired embedding model
   - Point data source to your Vector S3 bucket
   - Note the new KB ID

3. **Update your configuration**:
   ```bash
   aws lambda update-function-configuration \
     --function-name RAGStack-<project>-QueryKB \
     --environment Variables={KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ID=<new-kb-id>}
   ```

4. **Change embedding model in Settings**:
   - Go to Settings page
   - Change embedding model
   - Choose "Re-embed all documents"

5. **Wait for re-embedding to complete**

6. **Sync the new Knowledge Base**:
   - Go to AWS Console ‚Üí Bedrock ‚Üí Knowledge bases ‚Üí Data sources
   - Click "Sync" to index the new embeddings

**Alternative**: If recreating the Knowledge Base is not feasible, stay within the same model family.

#### Verifying Knowledge Base Compatibility

To verify your setup before changing embedding models:

```bash
# Get Knowledge Base embedding model
aws bedrock-agent get-knowledge-base \
  --knowledge-base-id <kb-id> \
  --query 'knowledgeBase.embeddingModelConfiguration.bedrockEmbeddingModelConfiguration.embeddingModelArn'

# Get current text embedding model from configuration
aws dynamodb get-item \
  --table-name RAGStack-<project>-Configuration \
  --key '{"Configuration": {"S": "Default"}}' \
  --query 'Item.text_embed_model_id.S'

# Compare the models - they should be from the same family
```

### Configuration Best Practices

#### For Cost Optimization
- **OCR Backend**: Use Textract for most documents
- **Bedrock OCR**: Only use for complex layouts or multilingual documents
- **Response Model**: Use Haiku for general queries, Sonnet/Opus for complex questions

#### For Production Workloads
- **Text Embeddings**: Use Titan Text v2 or Cohere English v3 for best quality
- **Re-embedding**: Always re-embed when changing models in production
- **KB Compatibility**: Verify Knowledge Base model before making changes

#### For Multilingual Content
- **Text Embeddings**: Use Cohere Multilingual v3
- **Bedrock OCR**: Use Sonnet or Opus models for non-English text
- **Response Model**: Sonnet handles multiple languages well

#### For Complex Documents
- **OCR Backend**: Switch to Bedrock with Sonnet or Opus
- **Response Model**: Use Sonnet or Opus for detailed answers

### Troubleshooting Settings

#### Settings Page Won't Load
- Check browser console for errors (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
- Verify you're signed in (session may have expired)
- Try refreshing the page

#### Configuration Not Saving
- Check for error messages in red alert boxes
- Verify you have network connectivity
- Check CloudWatch logs for ConfigurationResolver Lambda errors

#### Changes Not Taking Effect
- Configuration changes are immediate (no cache)
- Verify the Custom configuration was saved in DynamoDB:
  ```bash
  aws dynamodb get-item \
    --table-name RAGStack-<project>-Configuration \
    --key '{"Configuration": {"S": "Custom"}}'
  ```
- Check Lambda logs to confirm new configuration is being read

#### Re-embedding Job Stuck
- Check Step Functions console for execution status
- Review GenerateEmbeddings Lambda logs
- Job progress is tracked in ConfigurationTable with key `ReEmbedJob_Latest`

## Understanding Document Status

### Normal Processing Flow

```
UPLOADED ‚Üí PROCESSING ‚Üí GENERATING_EMBEDDINGS ‚Üí SYNCING_KB ‚Üí COMPLETED
```

**Typical timeline**:
- UPLOADED: Instant
- PROCESSING: 2-5 minutes (OCR)
- GENERATING_EMBEDDINGS: 1-3 minutes
- SYNCING_KB: 2-10 minutes (first time)
- Total: 5-20 minutes

### When Things Take Longer

Some documents may take longer:

**Large Documents (>20 pages)**:
- PROCESSING: 10-20 minutes
- GENERATING_EMBEDDINGS: 5-10 minutes (batched)

**Complex Layouts**:
- PROCESSING: 5-15 minutes (OCR needs more time)

**First Knowledge Base Sync**:
- SYNCING_KB: Up to 15 minutes (creates index)

### Stuck Documents

If a document is stuck in PROCESSING for >30 minutes:

1. Check the document details for errors
2. Review CloudWatch logs (see [Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md))
3. Try uploading the document again
4. Contact support if issue persists

## Tips and Best Practices

### Optimize Upload Performance

1. **Use PDF when possible**
   - PDFs process faster than images
   - Text-based PDFs skip OCR

2. **Upload in batches**
   - Upload 10-20 documents at a time
   - Wait for batch to complete before next batch

3. **Check file quality**
   - Use high-resolution scans (300 DPI)
   - Ensure text is readable
   - Remove blank pages

### Improve Search Accuracy

1. **Use complete sentences**
   - Better: "What is the refund policy?"
   - Worse: "refund"

2. **Be specific with context**
   - Better: "What was the revenue in Q4 2024?"
   - Worse: "revenue"

3. **Try different phrasings**
   - If first search doesn't work, rephrase
   - Use synonyms

### Manage Documents

1. **Use descriptive filenames**
   - Good: `2024-Q4-Financial-Report.pdf`
   - Bad: `doc1.pdf`

2. **Delete old documents**
   - Remove outdated documents from Dashboard
   - Reduces storage costs
   - Improves search relevance

3. **Monitor processing**
   - Check Dashboard regularly
   - Address failed documents quickly

### Security Best Practices

1. **Use strong passwords**
   - Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
   - Use a password manager

2. **Sign out when done**
   - Especially on shared computers
   - Sessions expire after 1 hour anyway

3. **Don't share credentials**
   - Each user should have their own account
   - Contact admin to create new users

### Cost Management

1. **Delete processed documents**
   - Once indexed, you can delete original files
   - Embeddings remain in Knowledge Base

2. **Use Textract backend**
   - Cheaper than Bedrock for most documents
   - Configure in [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md)

3. **Batch uploads during off-hours**
   - Reduces concurrency costs
   - Faster processing with less contention
