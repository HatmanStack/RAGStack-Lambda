# Encryption Configuration Analysis - Complete Index

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive analysis comparing encryption configurations between RAGStack-Lambda and the base Accelerated IDP repository has been completed. Three detailed reports have been generated documenting all encryption differences, recommendations, and migration paths.

## Key Finding

**No critical vulnerabilities detected.** Both repositories follow AWS security best practices. The difference is a strategic choice between:

- **RAGStack-Lambda**: Simpler AWS-managed encryption (0 custom KMS keys)
- **Base Repository**: Enterprise-grade customer-managed KMS encryption (1 custom key)
