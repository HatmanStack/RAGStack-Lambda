2. DYNAMODB ENCRYPTION
   RAGStack-Lambda: AWS-managed SSE (3 tables)
   - TrackingTable, MeteringTable, ConfigurationTable
   - SSEEnabled: true, no KMS key
   
   Base Repository: Customer-managed KMS (4+ tables)
   - SSEType: KMS with CustomerManagedEncryptionKey
   - Full audit trail via CloudTrail

3. SQS ENCRYPTION
   RAGStack-Lambda: SQS-managed SSE
   - ProcessingDLQ uses SqsManagedSseEnabled: true
   
   Base Repository: Customer-managed KMS
   - DiscoveryQueue, ConfigurationQueue, DocumentQueue use KMS

4. SNS ENCRYPTION
   RAGStack-Lambda: AWS-managed (alias/aws/sns)
   - AlarmTopic
   
   Base Repository: Customer-managed KMS
   - AlertsTopic uses CustomerManagedEncryptionKey

5. CODEBUILD ENCRYPTION
   Both use: alias/aws/s3 (AWS-managed)
   - NO DIFFERENCE

6. KMS KEY MANAGEMENT
   RAGStack-Lambda: NO custom KMS key (0 keys created)
   
   Base Repository: YES, 1 customer-managed KMS key
   - Type: AWS::KMS::Key
   - EnableKeyRotation: true
   - Alias: alias/{StackName}-customer-encryption-key
   - Key Policy allows: DynamoDB, CloudWatch Logs, S3, SQS, SNS, Glue

ENCRYPTION STRENGTH COMPARISON:
===============================

Service          RAGStack-Lambda          Base Repository         Difference
-------          ---------------          -------------------     ----------
S3 Buckets       AES256                   KMS (CMK)                Base is stronger
DynamoDB         AWS-managed SSE          KMS (CMK)                Base is stronger
SQS              SQS-managed SSE          KMS (CMK)                Base is stronger
SNS              AWS-managed              KMS (CMK)                Base is stronger
CodeBuild        AWS-managed              AWS-managed              SAME
Lambda           Default                  Default                  SAME
Cognito          Default                  Default                  SAME
AppSync          Default                  Default                  SAME

SECURITY IMPLICATIONS:
======================

RAGStack-Lambda Approach (AWS-Managed):
+ Simpler - no key management needed
+ Zero KMS operational overhead
+ Lower costs (no KMS charges)
+ Automatic AWS key rotation
- No audit trail for key access
- No control over encryption keys
- May not meet compliance requirements
- Less granular access control

Base Repository Approach (Customer-Managed KMS):
+ Full control over keys
+ Complete audit trail via CloudTrail
+ Meets strict compliance (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, etc.)
+ Fine-grained key policies
+ Manual + automatic key rotation
- Operational overhead (key management)
- Additional AWS costs (~$1-50/month for KMS)
- Risk of key lock-out
- More complex configuration

COST ANALYSIS:
==============

RAGStack-Lambda:
- S3 encryption: $0 (included in S3)
- DynamoDB encryption: $0 (included in pricing)
- SQS encryption: $0 (included in pricing)
- SNS encryption: $0 (included in pricing)
- Total KMS cost: $0/month

Base Repository:
- KMS key storage: $1.00/month
- KMS API requests: ~$0.03 per 10,000 requests
- Estimated total: $1-50/month (depends on usage)

COMPLIANCE RATING:
==================

RAGStack-Lambda: 
- AWS Config: Basic
- HIPAA: Weak (CMK required)
- PCI-DSS: Weak (CMK required)
- SOC2: Moderate
- GDPR: Adequate

Base Repository:
- AWS Config: Strong
- HIPAA: Strong (CMK enabled)
- PCI-DSS: Strong (CMK enabled)
- SOC2: Strong
- GDPR: Strong

RECOMMENDATIONS:
================

For RAGStack-Lambda - if enhanced security needed:

1. Create customer-managed KMS key (copy from base repo)
2. Update S3 buckets to use KMS encryption
3. Update DynamoDB tables with KMS SSEType
4. Update SQS queue to use KMS instead of SQS-managed
5. Update SNS topic to use customer-managed key

Estimated implementation time: 2-4 hours
Estimated cost impact: +$1-50/month for KMS

NO CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES FOUND:
===================================

Neither repository has encryption weaknesses that would be considered:
- Non-compliant with AWS best practices
- Vulnerable to unauthorized access
- Missing critical security controls

The difference is:
- RAGStack-Lambda: Simpler, faster deployment, lower cost
- Base Repository: Enterprise-grade, audit-ready, compliance-ready
