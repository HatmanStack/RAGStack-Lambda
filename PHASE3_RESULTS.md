# Phase 3 Results

## Test Results
- **Before Phase 3**: 12/22 tests passing (55%)
- **After Phase 3**: 18/22 tests passing (82%)
- **Improvement**: 6 tests fixed (+27%)

## Fixed Tests (6)
1. ✅ checks for existing re-embedding job on mount
2. ✅ displays success banner when re-embedding job is completed
3. ✅ triggers re-embedding job when user selects re-embed option in modal
4. ✅ handles re-embedding job error gracefully
5. ✅ dismisses completed job banner when user clicks dismiss
6. ✅ shows no banner when no re-embedding job exists

## Still Failing (4)
All 4 involve rendering IN_PROGRESS job status banners:

1. ❌ displays progress banner when re-embedding job is in progress
2. ❌ polls job status every 5 seconds when job is in progress
3. ❌ stops polling when job completes
4. ❌ calculates progress percentage correctly

## Investigation Needed
The failing tests share a common issue: the component doesn't render the IN_PROGRESS job banner despite:
- Proper mock sequencing (getConfiguration → getReEmbedJobStatus)
- Correct mock data structure
- Proper fallback mocks

**Possible causes:**
- React state update timing issue with our setInterval mock
- Component lifecycle interaction with custom interval mock
- Missing useEffect dependency or re-render trigger
- GraphQL response structure mismatch for IN_PROGRESS status

## Completed Work
- ✅ Created setInterval mock utility
- ✅ Removed Vitest fake timers
- ✅ Updated all `.skip` tests to run
- ✅ Fixed 6 out of 10 polling-related tests
- ✅ Improved test pass rate from 55% to 82%

## Recommendations
1. Debug component rendering with IN_PROGRESS status in isolation
2. Check if component's useEffect dependencies are correct
3. Verify GraphQL response structure matches what component expects
4. Consider if setInterval mock is interfering with React's internal state updates
